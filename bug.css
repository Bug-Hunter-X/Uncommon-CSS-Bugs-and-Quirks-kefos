The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage.  For instance, the following code might not work as expected:

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 50px);
}
```

If the parent element doesn't have a defined width, the calculation might be incorrect.  Similarly, mixing different units without proper conversion can cause issues.

Another common issue is with the `box-sizing` property. If you use `box-sizing: border-box;` but haven't considered the impact on padding and borders, your element's dimensions might be different from what you visually expect.  You can unintentionally create overlapping elements or content that flows outside its container.
